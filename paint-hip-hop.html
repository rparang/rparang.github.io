<a href="https://www.painthiphop.com/">Paint Hip Hop</a> is a hip hop music app. It was the first application I built and was influential in terms of my experience with web development and my confidence in front of code.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Iâ€™m telling you, I'm as cold as windows down in the winter<br>
And I be riding rims if my tires any thinner<br>
Airport stunting, flying charters overseas<br>
Full of Dom Perignon and the water for the D's  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>A user shares a song which builds playlists for those who follow that user. It uses a basic Twitter follow model.  </p>
<p>Popular tracks earn users rep points (check the shades). Rep points are achieved by people liking the shared song.  </p>
<p>When Paint Hip Hop launched in mid 2012, it had a fair bit of traffic (at least what I was expecting for a side project) that reached roughly 1,000 unique visitors for the month and 20 concurrent users at its peak.  </p>
<p>Paint Hip Hop is built with Ruby on Rails. The source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/rparang/jams">here</a>.  </p>
<p>I had contracted out the logo design on Dribbble, which turned out to be a surprisingly nice experience. The designer did a <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/Paint-The-Town/10297781">case study</a>.</p>
