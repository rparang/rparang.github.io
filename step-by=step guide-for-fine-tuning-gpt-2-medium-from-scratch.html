    <h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This blog post documents my full process and learnings while fine-tuning a GPT-2 Medium language model from scratch using the Alpaca instruction dataset. </p>
<p>It includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>My own dataloader implementation built to work with a from-scratch GPT-2 model following Andrej Karpathy’s Zero-to-Hero series.</li>
<li>Training a dataset of ~51,000 samples on an NVIDIA A100 for 2 epochs, reaching a validation loss of about 1.7.</li>
<li>Insights about how I handled special tokens, padding, and attention masking.</li>
<li>A walkthrough of resizing GPT-2 model layers to accommodate new tokens.</li>
<li>Example generations before and after fine-tuning to highlight the transformation from base model to assistant-style responses.</li>
</ul>
<p>All code is <a href="https://github.com/rparang/gpt2_finetune">available here</a>.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The goal of this project was to build and fine-tune a GPT-2 Medium model (355M parameters) from scratch, using a curated dataset with instruction-following examples. I was specifically interested in exploring supervised fine-tuning (SFT) — a key step in taking a generic base model and making it behave like an assistant, similar to ChatGPT.</p>
<p>Why did I take on this task?</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Gap in Karpathy’s Series:</strong> Andrej Karpathy’s excellent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0&amp;t=8270s">Zero-to-Hero series</a> walks through training a GPT-2 Small model (124M parameters) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8pRSuU81PU">from scratch</a>, but it ends before covering how to fine-tune a model.</li>
<li><strong>Desire for Deep Understanding:</strong> I noticed most tutorials and notebooks rely heavily on HuggingFace and PyTorch Dataloaders. While convenient, they abstract away too much. I wanted to learn what was happening under the hood by building things myself.</li>
<li><strong>Curiosity About LLMs in Practice:</strong> Fine-tuning is the bridge from a generic internet text generator to a helpful chatbot. I wanted to understand what happens when you go from pretraining on raw data to post-training on structured, goal-oriented prompts.</li>
</ol>
<p>This post is meant to largely record what I’ve learned and serve as a reference for my future self.</p>
<h2>Understanding Pretraining</h2>
<p>Pretraining a large language model means teaching it to predict the next token in a sequence. This is done by feeding it massive amounts of text and updating its parameters based on how well it guesses the next word or token.</p>
<p>Think of the model as a black box:
- Input: One or more tokens.
- Output: A probability distribution over the entire vocabulary (e.g., 50,256 tokens for GPT-2).</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Input: <code>"The cat sat on the"</code> → Output: A vector of 50,256 probabilities. The token <code>"mat."</code> should have a high probability (e.g., 0.98). This makes the model essentially a giant classifier, where the “classes” are the vocabulary tokens.</p>
<p>The model is trained to reduce its prediction error by calculating a <strong>loss</strong>. The most common loss function used is <strong>cross-entropy</strong>, which compares the predicted distribution to the correct token (expressed as a one-hot encoded vector).</p>
<h3>Why Cross Entropy?</h3>
<p>Cross-entropy gives us a scalar value that reflects how similar two probability distributions are — in our case:
The model’s predicted distribution: This is the output of the model after applying a softmax over the logits. It’s a probability distribution over the entire vocabulary. </p>
<p>For example, if the vocabulary size is 50,000, this will be a vector of 50,000 values that sum to 1.0. Each value represents the model’s confidence that a specific token is the correct next token.
The target distribution: This is a one-hot encoded vector representing the actual correct token. All values are 0 except for a 1.0 at the index of the correct token.</p>
<p>Cross-entropy loss compares these two distributions by computing the negative log probability that the model assigned to the correct token. In mathematical terms, if the model assigns a probability of 0.98 to the correct token, the loss is:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Loss = -log(0.98) ≈ 0.0202
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is a very low loss, meaning the model was highly confident and correct.
If the model is guessing randomly — meaning it assigns equal probability to all tokens — then each token gets a probability of 1/50,000. In that case:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Loss = -log(1/50000) ≈ 10.82
</code></pre></div>

<p>That would be expected from an untrained model. On the other hand, a well-trained model might assign around 1/3 probability to the correct token on average for unseen data:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Loss = -log(1/3) ≈ 1.1
</code></pre></div>

<p>So, the closer the predicted distribution is to the one-hot target, the lower the loss. Cross-entropy rewards the model for confidently predicting the correct token and penalizes it for being confidently wrong. It’s a simple yet powerful way to guide the model’s learning.</p>
<h2>What is Post-Training?</h2>
<p>Post training has a few categories but we will do “Supervised fine tuning” which amounts to taking the pretrained network, throwing away the old data corpus it trained on, and doing a much lighter weight training on a unique dataset with many step-by-step examples in the desired form of a response.\</p>
<p>These datasets are highly specialized to force the network to take on the personality of the training documents, all while keeping its structural understanding of the language from its pretraining. Meaning, we can take the internet document completer we got from pretraining and gently mold it into an assistant style chat bot that expects questions or directions, responds with an answer, and waits for another prompt. </p>
<p>Post training datasets are highly specialized and often proprietary. This is how companies like Scale AI get introduced. When you ask ChatGPT a question, and it responds in a standardized way (e.g., repeats the question, provides steps in how it approaches them, presents the steps, and a summary of its decision/recommendation), it’s because the training documents took on that shape. </p>
<h2>Dataset: Alpaca</h2>
<p>The dataset I used for SFT is the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca/main/alpaca_data.json">Alpaca dataset</a> released by Stanford. It contains 51,000 prompt-completion pairs created using GPT-3.5.</p>
<p>I initially tried <a href="https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/">SQuAD</a> but found it lacking because the completions were short and the context thin. Alpaca’s responses were more complete and better suited for modeling assistant-style behavior.</p>
<h3>Preprocessing the Dataset</h3>
<p>The original Alpaca file is a <code>.json</code> array. I wanted to convert it into <code>.jsonl</code> format for easier line-by-line parsing. I also combined <code>instruction</code> and <code>input</code> fields when both are present.</p>

<h2>Special Tokens and Dataloader</h2>
<p>We now need to introduce special tokens which I found to be the most interesting part of this exercise:</p>
<p>If you recall from above, a pretrained base model will just generate into infinity unless handled or prompted explicitly. A critical way how ChatGPT formats, introduces tool use, and knows when the LLMs generation is complete is through special tokens.</p>
<p>For example, our original vocabulary (now more precisely) of 50,256 tokens does not have the notion of an “end of statement” token, but we can introduce it during fine-tuning and train it, so that generations can end once that token is surfaced (note: the GPT2 tokenizer does include an &lt;|endoftext|&gt; token but it’s not used in this implementation). We can also introduce tokens that represent when the prompt begins, when the prompt ends/answer begins, and when the answer ends. Ultimately these become a type of markup in the training document similar to HTML/XML tags.</p>
<p>As a note, this is also how the LLM knows how to perform a search, or to construct python code, and many other magical experiences: It’s done by introducing special tokens, and having training documents teach the network when to use the documents. For example, a ‘&lt;|SEARCH|&gt;’ token could be introduced that will teach the network to surface the token to construct a Google query, in which an application will perform these, send all the results back to the LLM to interpret, and append it into the original user request.</p>
<p>We can introduce our special tokens when we initialize the data loader like so:</p>

<p>GPT2Tokenizer has a method add_special_tokens() which supports introducing key/value pairs as you need. I also saved these in a self.special_tokens attribute for easy reference later.</p>
<p>We load the training set into self.samples and split them into self.train_data and self.val_data with a 90%/10% split. These aren’t randomized first, so the validation will consistently be the last 10% of the dataset.</p>
<p>We also call encode_sample() when reading the datafile which does the heavy lifting for encoding and formatting our inputs and labels:</p>

<p>Note that input_ids now takes the shape of our question/answer format where we are marking up the text with our special tokens including <BOS> to indicate the beginning of a statement, <SEP> to indicate the when question ends and the answer begins, and the <EOS> that we’ll use to know when generation is over.</p>
<p>Some important callouts in how label_ids is treated:</p>
<ul>
<li>We stagger the label_ids to reflect how we want Cross Entropy to handle our predictions and labels.</li>
<li>We mask the question portion of the label_ids with -100 to force the network to only calculate loss for how well it’s predicting the answer portion. This is important because we don’t want the network to care about the question. Otherwise, if we did, we may find that the behavior of the network is such that when we ask it a question, it replies with a version of the same question followed by an answer (instead of the answer only).</li>

<p>Some notes on <code>get_batch()</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike pretraining, where you’ll typically have a uniform sliding window (where the length is your context window) across a massive data corpus where all words have been concatenated together, with post training, our samples have various lengths. While that’s the case, we still want to batch samples into the network for efficiency. What happens if we want batch_size=4 and the length of each samples input/label pairs are different? The solution is we pad them with another special token <PAD> in a way that we’ll always look for the max length (max_len) of the sample in the batch and pad the other samples to match that length. This creates tensors where each batch of B x T will have a length of T that differ batch to batch while each sample within a batch will have the same length. </li>
<li>Attention masking: this is unique to fine tuning in which we want our self-attention within the transformer to ignore padded tokens. This is important because we don’t want meaningless tokens like paddings to communicate with the others, since the token only exists due to the dynamic length nature of the samples described above. A way we tune this out is passing attention_mask through the forward pass of the model down into the attention mechanism, and removing any padded tokens in our inputs by having softmax ignore them, similar to how causal masking is done. For example, in our CausalSelfAttention class:</li>

</code></pre></div>

<p>After we apply our casual mask, if at attention_mask is passed, we simply convert any 0’s into negative infinity such that softmax removes it as candidate probabilities. There is some clever tensor manipulation to account for the 4 dimensional batch and number of attention head permutations via <code>attention_mask = attention_mask[:, None, None, :]</code>.</p>
<h2>Layer Resizing and Initialization</h2>
<p>This was the biggest learning experience for me where the importance of initialization became clear.</p>
<p>If you recall, our original GPT2 vocabulary size was 50,256, but we introduced 4 new special tokens. Without resizing, our network has no knowledge of the new tokens introduced and once the tokenizer returns one of these, we’ll get an out of range error once the token is passed to our embedding layer.</p>
<p>It’s worth calling out the two layers that are most impacted when introducing special tokens: the token embedding layer and the final project/linear layer that converts the computation from the hidden states onto our vocabulary distribution. The rest of the network remains in terms of size but these two layers need to be adjusted.</p>
<p>Specifically, we’ll introduce 4 new N dimensional matrices that represent these tokens where N is our embedding dimension. For GPT2 Medium, our embedding dimension is 1024, so each token will now have 1024 parameters in the embedding and projection layers, which all need to be trained.</p>

<p>After we resize, we have the issue of initialization. Ultimately what I learned is that as soon as you introduce these without careful handling, you throw the entire model out of distribution because the parameter values force the network to produce logits substantially greater than anything else and thus softmax spits out confidence for these tokens over and over again. You’ll see this very cleanly by generating text before and after the resizing:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">torch</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">no_grad</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="n">average</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">transformer</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">wte</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">weight</span><span class="p">[:</span><span class="n">old_vocab_size</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">mean</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">dim</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1"># Average of all embeddings across rows (vocab_size, n_embd) --&gt; (n_embd)</span>
    <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">transformer</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">wte</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">weight</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">data</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">old_vocab_size</span><span class="p">:]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">average</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This means these four have a much better starting point. And running generations on this network even before training brings it back to previous performance.</p>
<p>That is the bulk of it. The rest of the training was identical to pre training and will be familiar to those that have followed Karparthy’s video series.</p>
<p>There are a few learnings around hyperparameter tunings and what I suspect is intuition after training networks after awhile I’ll highlight:</p>
<ul>
<li>The learning rate was very sensitive where the sweet spot for me was 1e-5, having tested between 3e-4 and 1e-6. I didn’t create a learning rate scheduler mostly out of laziness but suspect this would have helped/</li>
<li>A weight decay of 0.05 worked well</li>
<li>I ended up adding dropout with a value of 0.2 which also seemed to help</li>
</ul>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>I achieved a loss of about 1.7 on my validation set after 2 epochs with a good trend on both training and validation losses. It makes me think I could have continued training for a bit more.</p>
<p><img alt="Training and validation losses" src="./images/loss.jpg"></p>
<p>We can see example generations by loading the model and calling our <code>generation()</code> method:</p>

<td>One day, I saw that the station seemed to be hopping with people, as if it were bustling with activity. As I got closer, I noticed a group of people milling around in the corner. From the corner of my eye, I noticed a large group of children wearing pink and yellow and waving their hands in the air. I turned my head and saw that a group of young children were walking together in the general direction of the station. I realized that this group of kids were running around with excitement, and that was a magical feeling! I decided to take that fun moment and run outside and join them. I followed their directions to some nearby parks and playgrounds, and soon found myself being chased by these little animals! I was mesmerized by the energy and joy that they were creating!&lt;EOS&gt;</td>

<td>Software engineers typically spend their days working on projects or development tasks, while they also work off-site or in other creative ways. They regularly update client systems, create custom code libraries, and write code that's used in various applications or systems. They also spend a lot of time on software design and development, and create automated test suites for software code. In some cases, they may also build and test new software applications, as well as optimize existing ones.&lt;EOS&gt;</td>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In upcoming posts, I plan to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explore evaluation strategies (e.g., perplexity, BLEU, ROUGE, and human feedback).</li>
<li>Host the model for inference using tools like Gradio, FastAPI, or Hugging Face Spaces.</li>
</ul>
