      <section><p><em>almost 7 years ago</em>
Recently I've been attempting the programming challenges on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210622222916/http://coderbyte.com/CodingArea/Challenges/">Coderbyte</a>. Coderbyte is a site that has a handful of questions that allots points given how 1) fast you complete the challenge and 2) how correct your answer is.</p>
<p>Once you solve a challenge correctly, it shows you solutions from other users, which might be its most addicting part. Typically I'll either scoff at someone's approach or look at their answer in amazement.</p>
<p>For one challenge though, I wasn't sure.</p>
<p>The challenge is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have the function BracketMatcher(str) take the str parameter being passed and return 1 if the brackets are correctly matched and each one is accounted for. Otherwise return 0. For example: if str is "(hello (world))", then the output should be 1, but if str is "((hello (world))" then the output should be 0 because the brackets do not correctly match up. Only "(" and ")" will …</p></blockquote></section>

      <section><h1>Coderbyte Scraping and Solutions</h1>
<p><em>over 6 years ago</em>
I wrote a quick Node app to scrape submitted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210622230023/http://coderbyte.com/CodingArea/Challenges/">challenges from Coderbyte</a> and to save them locally. Find it here: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210622230023/https://github.com/rparang/scrape_coderbyte">https://github.com/rparang/scrape_coderbyte</a></p>
<p>If you've spent time on challenges through the browser and realized it may be nice to have these saved for other purposes, this may be helpful.</p>
<p>Keep it mind, since this scrapes the site by parsing the returned HTML and doesn't use a dedicated Coderbyte API, it may not be stable.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210622230023/https://github.com/rparang/coderbyte/tree/master/challenges">See here</a> for the solutions to the challenges in Javascript (pulled using the Scrape Coderbyte app) that I've managed to solve. There are few remaining in "Medium Difficulty" and all in the hard category as of the time of this writing.</p>

      <section><p><em>Originally published in 2014</em></p>
<p>There has been <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8588080">recent</a> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-hiring-developers-foobar-challenge-2014-11">buzz</a> about a Google recruiting method called <a href="https://foobar.withgoogle.com/">Foobar</a>. Supposedly if you search enough programming-related issues like "python mutex lock," your account is flagged and you're offered to play a game with a series of programming challenges. If you do well, people claim you're invited for an interview.</p>
<p>Well, I wasn't offered to play this game. Thankfully, my friend was, and he shared one of the challenges below:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Peculiar balance</h3>
<p>Can we save them? Beta Rabbit is trying to break into a lab that contains the only known zombie cure - but there's an obstacle. The door will only open if a challenge is solved correctly. The future of the zombified rabbit population is at stake, so Beta reads the challenge:</p>
<p>There is a scale with an object on the left-hand side, whose mass is given in some number of units. Predictably, the task …</p></blockquote></section>
